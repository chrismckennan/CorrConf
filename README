# CorrConf
Estimate latent covariates in high dimensional data when individual samples are correlated (i.e. related).

The complete model for the data is Y = B X^T + Gamma Z^T + L C^T + E, where:
Y is a p (number of units, i.e. genes) x n (number of individuals or samples) matrix
X is a n x d matrix containing the covariates of interest
Z is a n x r matrix of known nuisance covariates whose effects Gamma you don't necessarily care about (i.e. plate effects, sex differences)
E is a p x n residual matrix, where the rows e_g have first and second moment (0, sigma_g^2 I_n + sigma_{g,1}^2 B_1 + ... + sigma_{g,b}^2 B_b) for $g = 1,...,p$.
	The matrices $B_j$ are known relatedness matrices (i.e. a kinship matrix, chip effect matrix, etc.)
C is a n x K matrix of latent covariates to be estimated. One can then do inference for B once C is known.
	This package estimates K and then estimates C in the presence of correlated residuals.
