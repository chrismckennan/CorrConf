Description: Estimates the unobserved n x K covariate matrix C in the model Y = BX^T + LC^T + E. Here Y (p x n) and X (n x d) are observed, where p is the number of units (i.e. genes) and n is the sample size. In addition, we assume the rows of E are independent of one another with first and second moment (0, sigma_{g,0}^2 * I_n + sigma_{g,1}^2 * B_1 + ... + sigma_b^2 * B_b), where the B_i's are observed psd n x n matrices that describe the sample relatedness.
