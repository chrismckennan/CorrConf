Description: Estimates the unobserved n x K covariate matrix C in the model Y = BX^T + GammaZ^T + LC^T + E. Here Y (p x n), X (n x d) and Z (n x r) are observed, where p is the number of units (i.e. genes), n is the sample size, d is the number of covariates of interest (i.e. disease status) and r is the number of nuisance covariates (like the intercept). In addition, we assume the rows of E are independent of one another with first and second moment (0, sigma_{g,0}^2 * I_n + sigma_{g,1}^2 * B_1 + ... + sigma_{g,b}^2 * B_b) for g = 1,...,p, where the B_i's are observed psd n x n matrices that describe the sample relatedness.
